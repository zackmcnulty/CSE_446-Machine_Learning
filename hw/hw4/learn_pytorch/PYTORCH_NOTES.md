# What is Pytorch
Pytorch is an improvement on numpy that can run operations on GPU for faster computing. Like the numpy ndarrays, 
tensors are generalizations of vectors and matrices to higher dimensions. Unlike the ndarrays however,
tensors come with a helpful property: autodifferentiation. Essentially, they can keep track of all the 
operations that have occured on them and their relationship to other tensors that are generated from
these operations. This allows them to quickly calculate the derivative of the output with respect to their
own entries. Helpful for gradient descent algorithms
